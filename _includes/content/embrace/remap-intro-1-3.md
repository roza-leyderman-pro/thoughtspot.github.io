You can modify the connection parameters by directly modifying the source mapping <code>yaml</code> file. ThoughtSpot creates it when you first add the connection. Remapping enables you to change a table or column to a different table or column in an existing database connection. To ensure that data displays correctly, ThoughtSpot recommends that you check all dependencies before and after remapping tables and columns.

To remap a connection, follow these steps:

1. Click **Data** in the top navigation bar.

2. Click the **Connections** tab at the top right corner of the page.

3. Click the name of the connection you plan to remap.
